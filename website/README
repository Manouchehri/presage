Project website deployment HOWTO
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The presage database username, password, and host can be obtained
from sourceforge.net project page by any user with administrator's
rights.


 o download drupal, the open source content management platform.
   drupal can be obtained from http://drupal.org.
   At the time of writing, presage website uses drupal-6.15.


 o install drupal by following the instructions found in file
   INSTALL.txt in drupal's directory.


 o install presage theme in sites/all/themes/ directory (create it if
   it does not exist)

     tar -C sites/all/themes/ -zxvf /path/to/presage_theme.tar.gz


 o populate drupal's database. If you followed the steps described in
   drupal's INSTALL.txt, you will have created a database and
   populated it with a set of tables that drupal needs.

   - unzip drupal database

     gunzip /path/to/presage_website_backup.sql.gz

   - restore database from drupal's database backup

     mysql -u user -p database < presage_website_backup.sql


 o checkout a local copy of source repository. This is needed to
   satisfy the website links to the documentation.

   - create a presage/ directory and change to it

     mkdir presage && cd presage

   - check out the source repository

     svn co https://presage.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/presage/trunk


 o generate API documentation


 o ensure that sites/default/settings.php is pointing to the correct
   database instance and that it is using the appropriate database
   user credentials (username and password)


To generate a database backup dump:
  mysqldump -u user -p database > presage_database_dump.sql
  gzip presage_database_dump.sql
